# Description

Webpack doesn't work in Visual Studio because of its large dependency graph.  Installing this package alongside it and then running `npm dedup` flattens the dependency graph and should fix things.

# To use

    npm i webpack --save
    npm i webpack-windows --save
    npm dedup

Note that both of these packages must be dependencies and NOT dev-dependencies, since `npm dedup` only works with devDependencies for some reason (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6036).
